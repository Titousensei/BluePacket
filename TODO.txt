=== Unit Tests ===
- negative tests for parser

=== Export Tests ===
- hash version
- to string
- load from text (yaml)
- save to text (yaml)

=== Possible Future Features ===
- bool -> pack bits in a byte automatically
- java helper BitSet for boolean[]
- enum automatically in 2 bytes if more than 255 elements
- xint: variable length int, mostly small.
  - start with a byte, if value == -128 read a short, if value == -127 read an int.
- enum power of 2 for masking, new type mask
- constants aliases native and enum
- default values native and enum

- load from / save to text (yaml-like)
- service stub declaration
  rpc RequetPacket -> ResponsePacket | ExceptionPacket
  handler MessagePacket
- legacy / deprecation mechanism
  - packets marked deprecated get suffix _<B58> with their hash
  - packets including deprecated packets print a warning / error if they don't have a deprecated version
- array with null elements
- data alignement hints

- converters: automatically build converter functions.
  Exact field types, all source fields must map.
    convert MyPacket => NewPacket
    NewPacket:
       from MyPacket
    -> NewPacket p = NewPacket.fromMyPacket(myPacket);
    -> p = MyPacket_to_NewPacket(myPacket)
  Cast field types when necessary, source fields not in dest ignored
    convert MyPacket -> NewPacket
  Custom field mapping
    convert MyPacket => NewPacket
      field1 => field2
      field3 -> field4
- "view" packets: definitions that are a subset of a full packet
- interfaces
  - composition of fields for subtyping
  - might be implemented as getters and setters
- exporters --enforceCamelCase or --enforceSnakeCase for all languages
  - else keep original spelling of field names
  - implemented in libexport
- encrypted bp
- distributions
  - pip install
  - jar
  - c# assembly?
- gen python __eq__
- packet sorting order by field as they are declared
- define .bpbin format:
  - BPk\0 header = single type, N packets
    - 8 bytes hash of the packet type
    - repeat:
      - X bytes for every packet
  - BPk\1 header = multi types, N packets
    - repeat:
      - 8 bytes hash of the packet type
      - X bytes for one packet

=== Languages ===
- HIPRI: rust, C, C++
- MEDPRI: nim, ocaml, zig, lua, javascript, typescript, kotlin, swift
- LOPRI: nelua, odin, roc, F#, io, Elixir, julia, haskell, crystal, gforth, Factor, reforth
- ?: SQL for automatic schemas (migrations ?)
- rpc client: pico-8 (lua), godot 4.x (python-like / C#)

=== Demos ===
- random access file  .bpbin
- connected client + server
- rpc client + server
- plain text API
  - load/save from text config .bptxt
  - same format as toString with or without \n
  - intermediate variables
  - https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Recursive_descent_parser
- subclass extends packet with utils (list of pairs to HashMap)
